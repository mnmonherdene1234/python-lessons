## What is python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was first released in 1991. It is designed to be easy to
read and write, with a syntax that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. Python is an object-oriented language,
which means that it uses classes and objects to organize code and data. It also has a large standard library that
provides a wide range of functionality, including modules for networking, databases, GUIs, web development, and more.
Python is widely used in a variety of industries and applications, from web development and scientific computing to data
